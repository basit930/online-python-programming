The web scraping software may directly access the <a href=""/wiki/World_Wide_Web"" title=""World Wide Web"">World Wide Web</a> using the <a href=""/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol"" title=""Hypertext Transfer Protocol"">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</a> or a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a <a href=""/wiki/Internet_bot"" title=""Internet bot"">bot</a> or <a href=""/wiki/Web_crawler"" title=""Web crawler"">web crawler</a>. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local <a href=""/wiki/Database"" title=""Database"">database</a> or spreadsheet, for later <a href=""/wiki/Data_retrieval"" title=""Data retrieval"">retrieval</a> or <a href=""/wiki/Data_analysis"" title=""Data analysis"">analysis</a>.

1,"<p>Web scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Once fetched, then extraction can take place. The content of a page may be <a href=""/wiki/Parsing"" title=""Parsing"">parsed</a>, searched, reformatted, its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be to find and copy names and telephone numbers, or companies and their URLs, or e-mail addresses to a list (contact scraping).

3,"<p><a href=""/wiki/Web_page"" title=""Web page"">Web pages</a> are built using text-based mark-up languages (<a href=""/wiki/HTML"" title=""HTML"">HTML</a> and <a href=""/wiki/XHTML"" title=""XHTML"">XHTML</a>), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form. However, most web pages are designed for human <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/End-user_(computer_science)"" title=""End-user (computer science)"">end-users</a> and not for ease of automated use. As a result, specialized tools and software have been developed to facilitate the scraping of web pages.
</p>"
4,"<p>Newer forms of web scraping involve monitoring data feeds from web servers.  For example, <a href=""/wiki/JSON"" title=""JSON"">JSON</a> is commonly used as a transport storage mechanism between the client and the web server.
</p>"
5,"<p>There are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing) their pages. In response, there are web scraping systems that rely on using techniques in  <a href=""/wiki/Document_Object_Model"" title=""Document Object Model"">DOM</a> parsing, <a href=""/wiki/Computer_vision"" title=""Computer vision"">computer vision</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Natural_language_processing"" title=""Natural language processing"">natural language processing</a> to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing.
</p>"
6,"<p>The history of the web scraping dates back nearly to the time when the World Wide Web was born.
</p>"
7,"<p>Web scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Semantic_web"" title=""Semantic web"">semantic web</a> vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Human-computer_interaction"" title=""Human-computer interaction"">human-computer interactions</a>. Current web scraping solutions range from the ad-hoc, requiring human effort, to fully automated systems that are able to convert entire web sites into structured information, with limitations.
</p>"
8,"<p>The simplest form of web scraping is manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a text file or spreadsheet. Sometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace a human's manual examination and copy-and-paste, and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation.
</p>"
9,"<p>A simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web pages can be based on the UNIX <a href=""/wiki/Grep"" title=""Grep"">grep</a> command or <a href=""/wiki/Regular_expression"" title=""Regular expression"">regular expression</a>-matching facilities of programming languages (for instance <a href=""/wiki/Perl"" title=""Perl"">Perl</a> or <a href=""/wiki/Python_(programming_language)"" title=""Python (programming language)"">Python</a>).
</p>"
10,"<p><a href=""/wiki/Static_web_page"" title=""Static web page"">Static</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Dynamic_web_page"" title=""Dynamic web page"">dynamic web pages</a> can be retrieved by posting HTTP requests to the remote web server using <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Socket_programming"" title=""Socket programming"">socket programming</a>.
</p>"
11,"<p>Many websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database. Data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template. In data mining, a program that detects such templates in a particular information source, extracts its content and translates it into a relational form, is called a <a href=""/wiki/Wrapper_(data_mining)"" title=""Wrapper (data mining)"">wrapper</a>. Wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a URL common scheme.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-2""><a href=""#cite_note-2"">[2]</a></sup> Moreover, some <a href=""/wiki/Semi-structured_data"" title=""Semi-structured data"">semi-structured data</a> query languages, such as <a href=""/wiki/XQuery"" title=""XQuery"">XQuery</a> and the HTQL, can be used to parse HTML pages and to retrieve and transform page content.
</p>"
12,"<p>By embedding a full-fledged web browser, such as the <a href=""/wiki/Internet_Explorer"" title=""Internet Explorer"">Internet Explorer</a> or the <a href=""/wiki/Mozilla"" title=""Mozilla"">Mozilla</a> browser control, programs can retrieve the dynamic content generated by client-side scripts. These browser controls also parse web pages into a DOM tree, based on which programs can retrieve parts of the pages. Languages such as <a href=""/wiki/XPath"" title=""XPath"">Xpath</a> can be used to parse the resulting DOM tree.
</p>"
13,"<p>There are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms. These platforms create and monitor a multitude of ""bots"" for specific verticals with no ""man in the loop"" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a specific target site. The preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically. The platform's robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites). This scalability is mostly used to target the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Long_Tail"" title=""Long Tail"">Long Tail</a> of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too labor-intensive to harvest content from.
</p>"
14,"<p>The pages being scraped may embrace <a href=""/wiki/Metadata"" title=""Metadata"">metadata</a> or semantic markups and annotations, which can be used to locate specific data snippets. If the annotations are embedded in the pages, as <a href=""/wiki/Microformat"" title=""Microformat"">Microformat</a> does, this technique can be viewed as a special case of DOM parsing. In another case, the annotations, organized into a semantic layer,<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-3""><a href=""#cite_note-3"">[3]</a></sup> are stored and managed separately from the web pages, so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages.
</p>"
15,"<p>There are efforts using <a href=""/wiki/Machine_learning"" title=""Machine learning"">machine learning</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Computer_vision"" title=""Computer vision"">computer vision</a> that attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-4""><a href=""#cite_note-4"">[4]</a></sup>
</p>"
16,"<p>There are many software tools available that can be used to customize web-scraping solutions. This software may attempt to automatically recognize the data structure of a page or provide a recording interface that removes the necessity to manually write web-scraping code, or some scripting functions that can be used to extract and transform content, and database interfaces that can store the scraped data in local databases. Some web scraping software can also be used to extract data from an API directly.
</p>"
17,"<p>The legality of web scraping varies across the world. In general, web scraping may be against the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Terms_of_use"" title=""Terms of use"">terms of use</a> of some websites, but the enforceability of these terms is unclear.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-5""><a href=""#cite_note-5"">[5]</a></sup>
</p>"
18,"<p>In the United States, website owners can use three major <a href=""/wiki/Cause_of_action"" title=""Cause of action"">legal claims</a> to prevent undesired web scraping: (1) copyright infringement (compilation), (2) violation of the <a href=""/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act"" title=""Computer Fraud and Abuse Act"">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a> (""CFAA""), and (3) <a href=""/wiki/Trespass_to_chattels"" title=""Trespass to chattels"">trespass to chattel</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-6""><a href=""#cite_note-6"">[6]</a></sup> However, the effectiveness of these claims relies upon meeting various criteria, and the case law is still evolving. For example, with regard to copyright, while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal, in the United States the courts ruled in <a href=""/wiki/Feist_Publications,_Inc.,_v._Rural_Telephone_Service_Co."" title=""Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.""><i>Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service</i></a> that duplication of facts is allowable.
</p>"
19,"<p>U.S. courts have acknowledged that users of ""scrapers"" or ""robots"" may be held liable for committing <a href=""/wiki/Trespass_to_chattels"" title=""Trespass to chattels"">trespass to chattels</a>,<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-7""><a href=""#cite_note-7"">[7]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-8""><a href=""#cite_note-8"">[8]</a></sup> which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. The best known of these cases, <i><a href=""/wiki/EBay_v._Bidder%27s_Edge"" title=""EBay v. Bidder's Edge"">eBay v. Bidder's Edge</a></i>, resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder's Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known as <a href=""/wiki/Auction_sniping"" title=""Auction sniping"">auction sniping</a>. However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to <a href=""/wiki/Personal_property"" title=""Personal property"">chattels</a>, the <a href=""/wiki/Plaintiff"" title=""Plaintiff"">plaintiff</a> must demonstrate that the <a href=""/wiki/Defendant"" title=""Defendant"">defendant</a> intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff's possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant's unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff.

The airline argued that FareChase's websearch software trespassed on AA's servers when it collected the publicly available data. FareChase filed an appeal in March 2003. By June, FareChase and AA agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-11""><a href=""#cite_note-11"">[11]</a></sup>
</p>"
21,"<p><a href=""/wiki/Southwest_Airlines"" title=""Southwest Airlines"">Southwest Airlines</a> has also challenged screen-scraping practices, and has involved both FareChase and another firm, Outtask, in a legal claim. Southwest Airlines charged that the screen-scraping is Illegal since it is an example of ""Computer Fraud and Abuse"" and has led to ""Damage and Loss"" and ""Unauthorized Access"" of Southwest's site. It also constitutes ""Interference with Business Relations"", ""Trespass"", and ""Harmful Access by Computer"". They also claimed that screen-scraping constitutes what is legally known as ""Misappropriation and Unjust Enrichment"", as well as being a breach of the web site's user agreement. Outtask denied all these claims, claiming that the prevailing law, in this case, should be <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/US_Copyright_law"" title=""US Copyright law"">US Copyright law</a> and that under copyright, the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection. Although the cases were never resolved in the <a href=""/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States"" title=""Supreme Court of the United States"">Supreme Court of the United States</a>, FareChase was eventually shuttered by parent company <a href=""/wiki/Yahoo!"" title=""Yahoo!"">Yahoo!</a>, and Outtask was purchased by travel expense company Concur.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-impervawp2011_12-0""><a href=""#cite_note-impervawp2011-12"">[12]</a></sup>
In 2012, a startup called 3Taps scraped classified housing ads from Craigslist. Craigslist sent 3Taps a cease-and-desist letter and blocked their IP addresses and later sued, in <i><a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Craigslist_v._3Taps"" title=""Craigslist v. 3Taps"">Craigslist v. 3Taps</a></i>.

22,"<p>Although these are early scraping decisions, and the theories of liability are not uniform, it is difficult to ignore a pattern emerging that the courts are prepared to protect proprietary content on commercial sites from uses which are undesirable to the owners of such sites. However, the degree of protection for such content is not settled and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper, the amount of information accessed and copied, the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner's system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-13""><a href=""#cite_note-13"">[13]</a></sup>
</p>"
23,"<p>While the law in this area becomes more settled, entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site.
